# Lookup Heroes #
> A simple function for looking up properties of objects that are in an array

## Background ##

I read an [article](https://goo.gl/4J38Qv) written by Eric Elliot
about the state of hiring in tech. In the article he gives some
example tests that he thinks would he suitable to give to a potential
candidate to solve during an interview. I thought it'd be fun to give
it a go.
